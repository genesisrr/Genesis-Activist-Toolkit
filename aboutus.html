     <h2>Why do we do this?</h2>
    <p> Our motivation behind this is knowing that we could be able to help someone in need of healthcare. We do this because everyone deserves it. Transportation and money shouldnÂ´t be barriers to get the help people need.
</p>

      <h2> What do we do?</h2>
      <p> With the help of donations, we can cover healthcare expenses of those in need of it. We also provide links for virtual healthcare.
